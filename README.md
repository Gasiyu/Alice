# Hugo Alice

*MistY's OWN* hugo theme.

**DISCLAIMER**: This theme is initially made for my own blog, I have been developed it in my spare time as entertaining for more than one year. Now I'm just tired of maintaining blog contents and its html/css/js in the same time, and some templates and code are very nasty since it's hardcoded and involves my personal customizations and contents. It's under pre-release stage and there might be breaking changes, use it at your own risk. The alpha release is scheduled on 2024-12-31.

## Installation

First, clone this theme to the `themes` directory of your hugo site:
```
git clone https://github.com/lixk28/Alice.git themes/Alice
```

Second, set `Alice` as your site theme in `config.toml`:
```
theme = "Alice"
```

## Documenation

Coming soon... It's a ton...

Now only *part* of the "Authoring Shortcodes" section is documented.

Build documentation locally:
```
hugo server --source=exampleSite
```

Then go to `http://localhost:1313`.

## Contribution

Bug fixes are always welcome.

Please fire an issue to draft a proposal first if you want some new feature.
