# Hugo Alice

*MistY's OWN* hugo theme for blogging.

## Installation

First, clone this theme to the `themes` directory of your hugo site:

```

Second, set `Alice` as your site theme in `config.toml`:

## Documenation

Coming soon... It's a ton...

Now only *part* of the "Authoring Shortcodes" section is documented.
